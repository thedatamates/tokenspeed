# Code Review Guidelines

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and any local overrides first. Map changed files to
the relevant TokenSpeed design documents below before reviewing.

## Severity

Prefix **every inline comment** with one of these markers:

| Marker | Severity | Meaning |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| 🔴 | **Important** | A bug that should be fixed before merging |
| 🟡 | **Nit** | A minor issue, worth fixing but not blocking |
| 🟣 | **Pre-existing** | A bug in the codebase not introduced by this PR |

For example:

> 🔴 **Important**: The buffer is sized to the capture ladder rather than the
> maximum decode batch. A larger eager batch will write past its capacity.

Explain the triggering condition, observable impact, and a concrete correction.
Verify findings against the surrounding code and callers; avoid speculative
bugs or performance claims without evidence. Check existing review threads and
do not repeat an unresolved finding. After posting inline comments, write a
brief summary with counts for each severity, including zero counts. Distinguish
pre-existing issues from regressions introduced by the PR.

## Focus on

- Production correctness, security vulnerabilities, resource lifetime errors,
  races, deadlocks, and silent failures or swallowed exceptions.
- Explicit execution modes and backend choices, preserved wrapper arguments,
  and validation that rejects unsupported configurations.
- Scheduler state transitions, admission/retraction/recovery, KV ownership,
  cancellation, and ordering of asynchronous forward and transfer work.
- Consistent behavior across eager/CUDA-graph execution, speculation,
  prefill/decode disaggregation, and supported hardware configurations.
- Kernel indexing, shapes, dtypes, strides, padding, numerical accuracy, and
  capability-based selection; vendor libraries must remain behind the kernel
  package boundary described in AGENTS.md.
- Tests that exercise the changed behavior, especially failure paths and
  boundary cases. Identify the missing regression case rather than demanding
  broad coverage without a concrete reason.
- Broken code/documentation references and configuration documentation that
  disagrees with the implementation.

## Domain references

Treat the design documents as the source of truth. Deliberate deviations must
be justified and documented in the same change.

| Changed area | Read |
| ------------ | ---- |
| Event loop and execution coordination | [Event loop](docs/design/event-loop.md): control/data plane separation, centralized feedback, in-flight depth, hooks |
| C++ scheduler | [Scheduler](docs/design/scheduler.md): chunk admission, retraction, engine roles, recovery invariants |
| Cache allocation, prefix reuse, transfer | [Cache concepts](docs/design/cache-concepts.md): logical/physical units, ownership, geometry, layering |
| Attention metadata and decode execution | [Unified decode path](docs/design/unified_path.md): refresh-in-place metadata, padding, buffer capacity, graph mechanics |
| QK norm, RoPE, KV quantization and KV writes | [Attention prologue](docs/design/attention-prologue.md): one entry, numerics contract, who writes the cache |
| KDA prefill graphs | [KDA prefill subgraphs](docs/design/kda-prefill-subgraphs.md) |
| Kernel registration and backends | [Kernel design](tokenspeed-kernel/README.md) and the affected operation's README |
| CI task declarations and validation | [CI task specs](test/ci/README.md) |
| Public serving configuration | [Server parameters](docs/configuration/server.md) and [parallelism](docs/serving/parallelism.md) |

## Skip

- Formatting-only changes and style comments already enforced by tooling.
- Documentation-only PRs under `docs/**`.
- Dependency version bumps with no code changes.

## Claude workflow setup and operation

[The workflow](.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml) runs both automatic
reviews and `@claude` replies on the self-managed runner scale set
`org-k8s-runner-cpu`. Grant this repository access to that runner set and install
the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) for this repository.
The workflow uses the app's short-lived token for reviews and replies.

As in the SMG workflow, provide `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` through the runner pod's
environment, typically from a Kubernetes Secret; the workflow passes it to the
Claude action. Do not commit the key or print it in logs. The runner needs Git,
`jq`, `curl`, `tar`, and network access to GitHub and the Anthropic API, plus the
prerequisites for `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`. The workflow installs the
Linux AMD64 GitHub CLI (`gh`) if it is missing.

Automatic reviews run for same-repository pull requests on `opened`,
`synchronize` (new commits), and `reopened`, including drafts. Fork PRs and runs
triggered by `dependabot[bot]` are skipped. PR events are also skipped when all
changed paths match `*.md`, `docs/**`, or `*.lock`.

Mention `@claude` in a new issue/PR conversation comment or inline PR review
comment to request a reply. Both jobs load the official `pr-review-toolkit`
plugin. This CPU runner reviews source and CI evidence; GPU tests remain in
the repository's existing CI workflows.

## CI workflow setup and operation

[The CI planning workflow](.github/workflows/pr-ci-plan.yml) handles same-repository
branch PRs on `opened`, `synchronize`, and `reopened`, including drafts. Fork PRs
and runs triggered by `dependabot[bot]` are skipped. It uses a GitHub-hosted CPU
runner and posts a coverage proposal for the exact head and base commits; a newer
push cancels the previous run. General code review remains with the existing
reviewer. It does not approve PRs, change required checks, or merge automatically.

The workflow calls [the planning script](.github/scripts/pr-ci-model.py) with
`prepare`, `plan`, and `publish` stages. Maintain the planner instructions in
[the agent prompt](.github/scripts/pr-ci-planner.md).

The API must implement the OpenAI-compatible protocol. Configure these organization
Actions variables and secrets with `all` repository access to share them across the
organization. Keep the publishing token as a repository secret:

| Setting | Kind | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KIMI_API_URL` | Organization variable | Provider API base URL, including its API version path |
| `KIMI_MODEL` | Organization variable | Model ID accepted by that endpoint |
| `KIMI_API_KEY` | Organization secret | API token for that endpoint |
| `LIGHTSEEK_BOT_TOKEN` | Repository secret | Token for `lightseek-bot` with organization variable read and PR comment write access |

The planner runs from a separate temporary directory with only `Read`, `Grep`, and
`Glob` tools. GitHub authentication is available only to the configuration and
publishing steps. Failed, empty, oversized, or sensitive output is not published;
raw CLI events and logs are not uploaded. Same-repository contributors can edit
the workflow, so repository write access remains the trust boundary.

[The coverage validator](.github/scripts/pr_ci_plan.py) reuses the existing task
loader and UT target discovery, including manual tasks. The planner verifies PR
title/body hints against changed code, callers and test assertions, then orders a
small set of focused test files and model CI tasks with code-to-coverage reasons.
Comments use one scope sentence, a priority table with short source-linked names,
and a status line; runner routing and material coverage limits stay explicit.
It does not append a full baseline merely because a shared directory changed.
Recommendations must refer to tracked test files and catalogued tasks/runners.
This is advisory prioritization; required checks and merge policy are unchanged.

Run diagnostics through the existing K8s Dispatch and Slurm Dispatch workflows.
Prioritize Slurm GB200 for NVIDIA, check GB300 if GB200 is full, and use K8s AMD
for AMD changes. Slurm recommendations retain declared logical runner labels;
they name the actual cluster separately and mark B200 tasks as cross-hardware.
For a single Slurm task use bulk mode (`yaml=off`) with its full config path as
`match`, one declared `runners` label, its `task_types`, and `trigger=all`; this
avoids single-YAML mode replaying multiple labels on the same physical cluster.
Retry Failed CI Cases replays retained Slurm reports. Completion evaluation,
automatic dispatch, source repair and merge-policy integration are separate work.
