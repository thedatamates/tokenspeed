"""Out-of-tree runtime plugins.

An installed distribution extends an unmodified runtime by declaring an entry
point in the ``tokenspeed.plugins`` group whose target is a no-argument
``register()`` that calls the functions in
:mod:`tokenspeed.runtime.plugins.registry`. Plugins activate by installation;
``TOKENSPEED_DISABLE_PLUGINS=a,b`` skips entry points by name.

Every process that builds a ``ModelConfig`` calls :func:`ensure_loaded` first,
so the frontend, the scheduler and the encode loop all resolve plugin
architectures the same way. Loading also runs the kernel package's own plugin
discovery, which registers plugin kernels before any model selects one.
