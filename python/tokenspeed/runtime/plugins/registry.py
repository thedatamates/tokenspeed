"""The registration surface of runtime plugins.

These functions are a plugin's whole import surface for registration. Each
writes one registry whose initial content is the in-tree table it replaced,
so in-tree and plugin entries resolve through the same lookup. A name that is
already registered raises unless the caller passes ``override=True``; an
override is logged, so replacing an in-tree entry is always a visible
decision in the plugin's source.

Registrations made while :func:`tokenspeed.runtime.plugins.ensure_loaded`
runs a plugin's ``register()`` are recorded under that plugin; if
``register()`` raises, they are undone so a failed plugin leaves no partial
state behind.
