    """Model-owned answers to the questions architecture tables used to answer.

    A registered model class exposes ``model_profile(hf_config)`` as a
    classmethod returning one of these. ``ModelConfig`` resolves it once, and
    every resolver that would otherwise match the architecture name against a
    table reads the profile instead. Every field is explicit: a profile that
    omits a fact is a construction error, never a silent fallback.

    Attributes:
        configure_attention: Writes the attention geometry onto the
            ``ModelConfig`` (``attention_arch``, head dimensions, scaling,
            a DSA model's ``index_k_format``), e.g. ``configure_mla_attention``
            or ``configure_dsa_attention``. Receives the resolved launch too,
            so a hook can key a choice on it (the index-K plane a model scores
            under ``server_args.numerics``, say); the in-tree hooks read none
            of it.
        cache_family: Registered cache recipe and pool family that owns this
            model's per-request state.
        linear_attention: Registered linear-attention backend serving the
            model's linear layers, or None for a model without them.
        default_attention_backend: Attention backend used when the launch
            names none, or None to keep the architecture default.
        default_prefix_granularity: Prefix granularity used when the launch
            keeps the server default, or None to keep that default.
        request_token_history: Whether the model reads each request's
            committed token history (``ForwardContext.request_token_history``).
        tokenizer_kwargs: Extra keyword arguments for the model's tokenizer.
        attention_instances_per_layer: Attention modules per decoder layer:
            1 for the ordinary stack, 2 for paired layouts (two attention
            branches sharing one layer's MLP block, e.g. LongCat's ScMoE) so
            the cache plans one plane per branch. Cache geometry, so it has
            no fallback: an omitted count would undersize the cache.
        numerics_envelopes: The ``--numerics`` envelopes the model is verified
            under, always including ``"auto"``. A model lists ``"rl-bitwise"``
            only once the bitwise invariance harness and the teacher-forced
            logprob comparison against the trainer pass for it; launching an
            unlisted envelope is refused.
