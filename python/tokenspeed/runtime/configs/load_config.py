    download_dir: Directory to download and load the weights, default to the
        default cache directory of huggingface.
    load_format: The format of the model weights to load:
        "auto" will try to load the weights in the safetensors format and
            fall back to the pytorch bin format if safetensors format is
            not available.
        "pt" will load the weights in the pytorch bin format.
        "safetensors" will load the weights in the safetensors format.
        "instanttensor" will load the safetensors weights on NVIDIA GPUs
            using InstantTensor, which accelerates loading via distributed
            loading, pipelined prefetching, and direct I/O (with optional
            GPUDirect Storage support).
        "npcache" will load the weights in pytorch format and store
            a numpy cache to speed up the loading.
        "dummy" will initialize the weights with random values, which is
            mainly for profiling.
    ignore_patterns: The list of patterns to ignore when loading the model.
        Default to "original/**/*" to avoid repeated loading of llama's
        checkpoints.
    decryption_key_file: If set, decrypts the output files with a password read
        from this file (after PBKDF2).
    checkpoint_load_group: Global ranks a distributed loader (InstantTensor)
        synchronizes with when the model declares no ``checkpoint_load_group``
        of its own; None means every rank. A model loaded on a subset of the
        ranks -- a pipeline stage's draft -- must name that subset, or the
        collective waits for ranks that never load it.
