        mlp-side AttnRes prefix combine also rides its epilogue and the mixed
        hidden comes back as the second return (else None -- block-write
        layers, large batches and the plain-reduce fallback).

        The tokenspeed collective is the exception: it serves the narrow window
        ahead of those branches and returns None for the mixed hidden even when
        ``combine`` is set, so the caller runs the combine as its own kernel.
        Measured net faster despite the extra launch at the width that
        actually reaches it -- one token per step, where every layer but the
        block-write ones arrives with a residual. Wider steps mostly take the
        fused AttnRes graph instead, and the block-write layers that still
        arrive pass no prefix: instrumented at eight tokens on a DSpark
        deployment, this window was armed and served nothing. A layer that
        declines the fused graph for some other reason does reach it with a
        prefix, so that is a property of the configuration, not of the width.

        Like the vendor branch below it, that window does not consult
        ``force_deterministic_rsag``: the collective reduces in ascending rank
        order with an fp32 accumulator, so it is already run-to-run stable.

        ``mlp_wp`` is the calling layer's precomputed ``rms_w * res_w``
        product (per-layer state, filled in post_load_weights); the B1
        combine kernels consume it in place of the separate weights.
