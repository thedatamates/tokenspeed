"""Pipeline-stage boundary state and layer-window helpers.

A pipeline stage's forward either consumes a :class:`PPStageState` received
from the upstream stage (mid-pipeline) or produces one for the downstream
stage. The tensor geometry is fully derivable from the token count plus model
config on both sides — every PP rank runs the same deterministic scheduler —
so the wire protocol is a fixed-order sequence of raw tensor sends with no
metadata exchange.
