"""Pause / resume control state for a scheduler event loop.

The pause gate lives in Python: requests are admitted to the scheduler from the
event loop (``scheduler.submit_requests``), so withholding new work while paused
is handled here rather than inside the scheduler itself.

Two classes split the work: :class:`PauseController` owns the state machine and
is driven by the request handler (control plane); :class:`PauseHooks` is the
EventLoop-side integration — everything the pause/resume API needs from the
loop lives there, so the loop's normal scheduling paths carry single-line
hooks only.

Modes (how a pause treats in-flight requests):

- ``abort``: cancel in-flight requests, then drain and reply.
- ``wait`` : let in-flight requests finish naturally, then drain and reply.
- ``keep`` : freeze everything in place; reply immediately; resume later.

``abort`` and ``wait`` both leave the scheduler in ``PAUSED_NEW`` (no new
requests admitted, running requests keep stepping) and defer their reply until
the scheduler has drained. ``keep`` moves to ``PAUSED_ALL`` (nothing scheduled)
and replies immediately.
