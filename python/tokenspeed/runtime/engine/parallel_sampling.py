"""Tokenized-payload prep for parallel-sampling (n>1) fan-out.

The scheduler treats each replica as a standalone rid (the n>1 expansion
happens at the AsyncLLM frontend, not on the scheduler), so there is no
per-replica scheduler state here. What we need to centralize is the
tokenized-payload mutation the fan-out loop performs on every replica:
rid regeneration, the ``max_new_tokens=0`` warmup variant, and the plain
replica copy.

The two functions below are pure (no engine state, no I/O) and are
called from ``AsyncLLM._handle_batch_request`` once for the prefix
warmup and ``parallel_sample_num`` times for the replica expansion.

    ``copy.copy`` of the same tokenized payload, so without an independent
    copy they would publish only once (the 2nd+ ``publish`` is a no-op
    because the feature is already a handle) and share the SHM segment.
