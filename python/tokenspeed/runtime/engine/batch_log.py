"""The per-round operator log lines ("Prefill batch." / "Decode batch.").

These describe a SCHEDULER round -- what was admitted, how deep the queue
is, how full the KV pool is, how fast committed tokens are coming out --
so they belong to the control plane, where all of those numbers already
live. Logging them from the executor instead meant threading page and
queue counts down through the dispatch path and across the forward thread
purely to reach a ``logger.info``, and left the decode counters written on
the control plane (at commit) but read on the forward thread (at execute).

Here, the loop dispatches, commits, and logs in one place on one thread:
``log_dispatch`` prints the round, ``record_decode`` folds committed
results into the throughput window, and the executor stays free of
scheduler arguments.
