"""L2 cache-op submission and rank-synchronized completion tracking.

Owns everything between an execution plan's cache ops and the scheduler
events their completions eventually produce: count what the plan puts in
flight (``DeviceHandle.execute`` submits the transfers themselves, on the
data plane, from the same plan), poll
completions (control-side event queries), and agree across every
cache-owning rank in the replica (attention TP, then CP, then PP) on
which completions EVERY rank has seen (the C++ scheduler is mirrored, so an
event may only advance once all ranks hold it). L3 Host backups complete
asynchronously, so a rank-local ``WriteBackDone`` would ``CacheHostBlock``
on one mirrored scheduler while a CP/PP peer still has the op pending.
Every rank enters every replica-group gather, including with an empty
intermediate intersection; skipping a later CP/PP ``all_gather_object``
hangs ranks whose first group already agreed. An L3 backup future that
fails is converted into a rank-local flag and MAX-reduced on that same
first replica all_reduce so every rank raises together instead of one
rank raising out of ``poll_results`` while peers wait in the gather.
``poll_ready_events`` returns events for the event loop to apply —
feedback into the scheduler stays an explicit ``advance_scheduler`` call
in the loop body.

Depends only on the device handle and static parallel-layout config, not on
live event-loop state. ``device=None`` (kvstore disabled) makes every method
a cheap no-op.
