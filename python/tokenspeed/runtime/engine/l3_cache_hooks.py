"""L3 admission probes and prefetch recovery for the scheduler event loop.

The scheduler and DeviceHandle are explicit dependencies; no live loop state
is needed. DeviceHandle owns storage operations and per-plan prefetch result
capture. These hooks only coordinate Host-tier probes and their replica-wide
outcomes, returning recovery events for the loop's single tail advance.
``device=None`` disables L3 work while preserving ordinary request admission.
