"""Original multi-depth MTP drafter (e.g. Inkling).

Hosts speculative drafting for MTP heads with multiple distinct depth
layers, where speculative step ``d`` runs depth layer ``d`` over a shifted
window and rejected drafts leave per-depth KV slots to repair (extend
catch-up, frontier-anchored decode windows, the cross-round drafter stash).

Eagle-like MTP (MTP-Eagle: a single MTP layer chained on its own hidden,
e.g. DeepSeek) stays in ``eagle.py``. Both register under
``--speculative-algorithm MTP``; ``ModelExecutor`` routes multi-depth
draft model classes to this drafter (see ``get_drafter_impl``; an
out-of-tree draft opts in with
``register_drafter("MTP", Mtp, model_cls=...)``).

Draft model contract
--------------------

A draft model served by this drafter implements:

* ``forward(ctx, input_ids, positions, input_embeds=None,
  captured_hidden_states=None, spec_step_idx=0, **kwargs)`` returning a
  ``LogitsProcessorOutput`` whose ``hidden_states`` carries the FULL
  per-row post-depth hidden (the next depth's chain input). ``spec_step_idx``
  must be a named parameter: ``ModelRunner`` forwards it only to a
  ``forward`` whose signature declares it (``**kwargs`` alone does not
  count), and a model without it would silently run depth 0 for every step.
  ``ForwardMode.IDLE`` with zero rows (``captured_hidden_states=None``) must
  run the model's collectives without attention — that is what an idle
  attention-DP rank calls.
* ``num_mtp_layers``: the number of depth layers built. Depth selection is
  ``layers[spec_step_idx % num_mtp_layers]`` and depth ``d`` writes its KV
  to the draft cache layer ``d`` (per-depth planes, cache layer ids
  ``0..N-1``), so a step count above it would wrap onto plane 0 and
  overwrite it; ``Mtp`` refuses ``num_mtp_layers < spec_num_steps`` at
  construction.
* Every input row flows through the depth's MoE / dense collectives (there
  is no per-request narrowing: the decode window is ``k`` rows per request
  at every depth), so the model keeps the default collective sizing and
  does NOT report ``global_bs`` through ``report_collective_sizing`` the
  way the Eagle-chain heads do.
* ``get_embed_and_head()`` / ``set_embed_and_head(embed, head)``: the
  embedding and LM head are shared from the target
  (``shares_target_embed_head``); a draft needing a request-token-history
  view is refused at startup (``supports_request_token_history``).
* ``checkpoint_weight_name_filter(name)`` plus ``load_weights`` mapping the
  checkpoint's per-depth tensors onto ``layers[d]``.
