"""Drafter registry: resolve a speculative algorithm to its drafter class.

The in-tree algorithms stay lazily imported (drafter modules pull in kernel
ops and model code, and this package init must stay importable from
lightweight contexts). Plugins extend the table through
:func:`register_drafter`: either a new algorithm name, or a draft-model-class
scoped entry that specializes an existing algorithm the way the in-tree
Inkling/DFlash2/DSpark cases do.
