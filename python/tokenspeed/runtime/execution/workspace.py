"""One shared scratch block per device for per-operation kernel workspaces.

The contract, which every caller must hold to:

* **Re-fetch every use; never hold a view across ``allocate`` calls.** Growth
  drops the block and allocates a larger one, so the address changes; a held
  view keeps the dead block alive and reads stale bytes forever. Addresses are
  only stable once the pool is frozen.

* **Request everything an operation needs in one call.** Views from a single
  ``allocate`` never overlap; views from separate calls deliberately share the
  same bytes. The reuse is the point -- the block converges to the largest
  single request instead of the sum of every caller.

* **Main stream only.** Cross-call reuse is safe because callers launch their
  kernels in order on one stream, so an earlier op is done with its scratch
  before a later op's kernels run. Work on a side stream runs concurrently and
  must bring its own buffer.

* **The block must reach its peak before the first CUDA-graph capture.** A
  graph records the raw address of any view captured into it, so the executor
  freezes the pool right before capture and a frozen pool refuses to grow
  (naming the caller that asked). Consumers therefore warm the block to their
  peak when they are constructed -- see the trtllm backend.

Sizing policy (constants, batch shapes, env overrides) belongs to callers; the
pool only carves.
