"""Breakable CUDA graphs for prefill (extend) forwards.

:class:`PrefillGraph` holds one breakable graph per padded token bucket
(captured from a dummy bs=1 extend batch). The embedding lookup stays OUTSIDE
the captured region: graphs start from a static input-embeds buffer, filled at
replay by an eager ``embed_tokens`` gather (text) or by precomputed merged
embeddings (multimodal, via the model's ``multimodal_input_embeds`` seam).
Constructed after the decode
:class:`~tokenspeed.runtime.execution.cuda_graph_wrapper.CudaGraphWrapper`,
borrowing its capture stream; buckets share one private mempool, deliberately
not the decode graphs' pool (see :meth:`capture`). At serving time
the executor's target-forward dispatch is a flat
three-way -- decode & captured replays the decode graph (one level up, since
it captures the whole step), prefill & captured replays here (:meth:`can_run`
/ :meth:`replay`), everything else runs the eager model forward.

Unlike decode (whole forward captured, keyed by batch size), the captured
region here is purely token-shaped compute keyed by total token count:
attention runs as an eager break (see
:mod:`tokenspeed.runtime.execution.breakable_cuda_graph`), so one graph per
bucket serves any batch size at that token count, and a replayed forward is
finished with the model's eager logits tail.

    Unlike decode (keyed by batch size), the breakable prefill graph captures
    pure token-shaped compute, so it is keyed by total token count. A live extend
    forward is padded up to the smallest bucket >= its token count; forwards above
    the largest bucket run eager.

    Returns an empty list (graph disabled) when ``disable_prefill_graph`` is set or
    ``prefill_graph_max_tokens <= 0``. The largest bucket is clamped to the
    chunked-prefill size: the scheduler's per-forward token budget
    (``max_scheduled_tokens`` = chunked-prefill size) covers extends AND any fused
    decode rows -- with mixed batching, decodes are scheduled first and each
    decrements the budget, and the prefill chunk is sized to what remains
    (scheduler ``newForwardOperation``/``push_op``) -- so no forward, mixed or
    pure, ever exceeds the chunk. No headroom above it is needed.

    The default ladder bounds RELATIVE padding waste: a forward pads its graphed
    compute to the next bucket, so what matters is the gap as a fraction of the
    size -- a flat stride is needlessly coarse for short prompts and needlessly
    dense at the top. Each bucket's step is the largest power of two <= size/8
    (padded tail at most ~12.5% anywhere on the ladder), floored at 16 tokens and
    capped at 512 so the absolute worst case stays bounded at the top end. Dense
    ladders are cheap: all captures share one stream + mempool, so graph memory
    is ~the largest bucket's peak regardless of bucket count (see
    ``BreakableCapture``); the remaining cost is ~0.5s of startup capture per
    bucket.

    ``prefill_graph_capture_sizes`` overrides the ladder with an explicit list
    (mirroring decode's ``cudagraph_capture_sizes``) -- e.g. a short list for
    faster startup on dev boots; sizes are clamped to the largest bucket.
