"""Breakable CUDA graphs for prefill (extend) forwards.

:class:`PrefillGraph` owns captures keyed by ``(token_bucket, exact_bs)``.
``exact_bs=None`` denotes ordinary segments with eager attention breaks.
Dummy batches balance tokens across the selected nonempty request count.
The embedding lookup stays OUTSIDE
the captured region: graphs start from a static input-embeds buffer, filled at
replay by an eager ``embed_tokens`` gather (text) or by precomputed merged
embeddings (multimodal, via the model's ``multimodal_input_embeds`` seam).
Capture borrows the decode
:class:`~tokenspeed.runtime.execution.forward_step.ForwardStepRunner`'s
stream; buckets share one private mempool, deliberately not the decode graphs'
pool (see :meth:`capture`). At serving time
the executor's target-forward dispatch is a simple
three-way -- decode & captured replays the decode graph (one level up, since
it captures the whole step), prefill & captured replays here (:meth:`can_run`
/ :meth:`replay`), everything else runs the eager model forward.

Ordinary captures keep attention at eager breaks (see
:mod:`tokenspeed.runtime.execution.breakable_cuda_graph`) and reuse the
token-shaped segments across batch sizes. Inline captures include compatible
KDA at a fitting request capacity; full attention keeps its breaks. Mixed batches,
request counts beyond captured capacity, layerwise transfer and DP retain
the ordinary route, subject to its admission rules. Both routes finish with
the model's eager logits tail.

A :class:`NarrowingPrefillModel` drops its row count once, at a fixed layer,
by a completion-dependent amount (DeepSeek-V4.1's CED decoder runs on each
prompt's last window). One token-shaped graph cannot express that, so such a
model is captured as two graph families around an eager narrowing: encoder
graphs per token bucket (``encoder_forward``) and decoder graphs per
decoder-row bucket (``decoder_forward`` from a fixed-row static state). The
decoder graphs depend only on their row count, so they are shared by every
token bucket; a forward whose narrowed rows exceed the largest decoder bucket
runs its decoder stage eager after the encoder replay. Under attention DP the
narrowed row count is rank-local, so the split graph is disabled there.

    Both ordinary and inline captures use this total-token capacity ladder;
    inline captures additionally select a fitting request capacity. A live extend
    forward is padded up to a bucket fitting its tokens and any dummy scan slots.
    Forwards above the largest bucket run eager.

    Returns an empty list (graph disabled) when ``disable_prefill_graph`` is set or
    ``prefill_graph_max_tokens <= 0``. The largest bucket is clamped to the
    chunked-prefill size: the scheduler's per-forward token budget
    (``max_scheduled_tokens`` = chunked-prefill size) covers extends AND any fused
    decode rows -- with mixed batching, decodes are scheduled first and each
    decrements the budget, and the prefill chunk is sized to what remains
    (scheduler ``newForwardOperation``/``push_op``) -- so no forward, mixed or
    pure, ever exceeds the chunk. No headroom above it is needed.

    The default ladder bounds RELATIVE padding waste: a forward pads its graphed
    compute to the next bucket, so what matters is the gap as a fraction of the
    size -- a flat stride is needlessly coarse for short prompts and needlessly
    dense at the top. Each bucket's step is the largest power of two <= size/8,
    floored at 16 tokens and capped at 512 so the absolute worst case stays
    bounded at the top end. The ~12.5% tail that step implies holds only where
    size/8 exceeds the floor: below ~128 tokens the floor dominates and the
    relative waste grows sharply (17 -> 32 pads 88%, 1 -> 16 pads 1500%),
    which is where a graphed forward is least likely to pay for itself.
    Captures share a stream and mempool to reuse scratch, and share output and
    break-handoff buffers; graph objects and stable metadata are retained per
    configuration. Total memory
    is not determined by the largest bucket alone; denser ladders also add
    startup capture work.

    ``prefill_graph_capture_sizes`` overrides the ladder with an explicit list
    (mirroring decode's ``cudagraph_capture_sizes``) -- e.g. a short list for
    faster startup on dev boots; sizes are clamped to the largest bucket.

        one PRIVATE mempool (first capture
        allocates it) to reuse scratch; graph objects and metadata still cost
        memory per variant. Never use the decode graphs' pool: eager ops cache
        raw pointers to
        buffers they lazily allocated inside a decode capture (flashinfer's
        trtllm-gen MoE runner), and a prefill capture reusing those freed
        blocks means every replay rewrites them, corrupting the next eager
        call (IMA; A/B-proven on qwen3.5 MTP).

        Runs under inference mode like serving forwards (in-place updates on
        inference-mode model state buffers are only legal there). There is no
        handler here: every failure kills the boot, OOM included (the graph
        pool did not fit next to weights + KV cache -- free headroom, lower
        ``--prefill-graph-max-tokens``, or set it to 0). A model family that
        cannot capture has to say so up front in ``ModelExecutor``'s
        ``disable_prefill_graph`` condition, because degrading here silently
        served eager prefill to a whole model family while CI stayed green.

        backend sizes its own per-request tables from

        router's table stacks; V4's bespoke metadata build). The width is
        a property of the group's published
        spec, not of the kernel that reads it, which is why no per-backend
        knob is needed.

        helper answers the decode question, where a row describes live cache

        with no window bound, so a window-sized row underflows.
        Trying the helper here made Inkling capture die with "extend write
        locations out of table bounds" -- its ``sliding_attention_0`` row was
        6 columns against the 63 the bucket needed.

        Blocks are distinct per row because a state group takes one working
        block per request; two rows sharing one clobber each other. Note the
        runtime check for that (``_gather_state_block_indices``) is gated on

        ``test_each_capture_row_gets_its_own_block`` is the guard.
