"""EPD prefill-side receive glue: fill each multimodal item's ``encoded``
tensor from the Mooncake transfer instead of running the vision tower.

Inverse of ``encode_executor.assign_encoded_embeddings``: the encode worker
row-splits the tower output per item and column-splits the deepstack half; here
the prefill allocates a receive buffer sized to each item's post-merge token
count (and deepstack width), registers it with that item's encode worker via
:class:`MooncakeEmbeddingReceiver`, waits for the push, and assigns the result
onto ``item.encoded`` / ``item.encoded_deepstack`` -- the ``skip-ViT`` form the
prefill ``VisionEmbedder`` consumes (it never re-encodes an item whose
``encoded`` is already set). A wrong token count or deepstack width mis-sizes the
RDMA target (silent corruption), so buffer-sizing + assignment is isolated and
CPU-unit-testable with a fake receiver.

Poll-driven state machine (:class:`EmbeddingReceiveJob`): ``start()`` does only
the non-blocking Phase-1 allocation + receiver construction (it must NEVER block
the prefill event loop); ``poll()`` advances every receiver a little each cycle
and publishes ``item.encoded`` only once EVERY handshaked item has landed. The
scheduler holds the job and does not admit the request to a prefill forward until
``poll()`` returns ``DONE``.

``receive_encoded_embeddings`` is a thin BLOCKING wrapper (start + spin poll) for
synchronous callers and the CPU tests.

        # ... each cycle, until DONE/FAILED:
        status = job.poll()        # PENDING | DONE | FAILED

    ``start()`` (the constructor) runs Phase-1 only: it sizes + allocates each
    handshaked item's receive buffer, registers it with the Mooncake engine, and
    constructs one :class:`MooncakeEmbeddingReceiver` on the item's room (the
    receiver's own ``__init__`` performs the bootstrap handshake). It does NOT
    wait for any transfer and does NOT call ``pre_alloc`` -- that is deferred to
    ``poll()``, which issues each ``pre_alloc`` lazily once its receiver reports
    Bootstrapped and then waits (across cycles, never blocking) for Success.

    HARD CONSTRAINT: one room/receiver PER ITEM. A single request's
    items may be served by DIFFERENT encode workers, so collapsing to one
    receiver per request is not possible. ``poll()`` returns DONE only when every
    item's receiver is Success.

    Buffer lifetime: by default the receive target is a leased slot from the
    lifetime-registered :class:`_RecvBufferPool`; on DONE the landed rows are
    cloned onto ``item.encoded`` and the slot is reused after that copy completes
    (no MR churn, see the pool docstring). Deepstack models, oversized items, pool
    exhaustion, or ``TOKENSPEED_EPD_RECV_POOL_SLOTS=0`` fall back to a per-request
    buffer registered on start and lazily deregistered after publish. Pooled
    slots stay leased until the CUDA copy into ``item.encoded`` has completed,
    so a following request cannot overwrite rows still being cloned. The GPU cost
    per request is roughly ``n_tokens * hidden * dtype.itemsize`` (plus ``* (1 +
    num_deepstack)`` with deepstack); the caller should cap the number of
    in-flight jobs accordingly.

    Idempotent re-`start`/poll: items whose ``item.encoded`` is already set
    (chunked prefill re-runs the receive per Path-4 forward on the same item) are
    SKIPPED at start time -- no receiver is constructed for them.
