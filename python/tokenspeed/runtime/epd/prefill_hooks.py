"""EventLoop-side EPD prefill integration.

Split of responsibilities, mirroring pause.py's PauseController/PauseHooks:
``EpdPrefillAdmission`` (prefill_admission.py) DECIDES — it owns the receive
jobs, the rank-synced admission drain, and the optional NCCL row-shard
reassembly. ``EpdPrefillHooks`` here ACTS on those decisions with the event
loop's collaborators, so the loop's normal scheduling paths carry single-line
hooks only.
