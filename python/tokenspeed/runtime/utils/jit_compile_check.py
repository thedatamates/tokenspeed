"""Reporting Triton JIT compilations on the serving path.

A kernel compiles on the forward thread the first time it sees a new
compile-cache key, and the round waits for it (100+ ms per Triton kernel).
Startup compiles on purpose -- weight processing, tuning, graph capture -- so
the scheduler process installs ``tokenspeed_kernel.compile_monitor`` before it
builds anything and marks the end of startup as its last step before entering
the round loop, next to the data-plane sync debug. From then on every
compilation is logged, and a compile-time kernel parameter that keeps taking
new values -- the signature of a per-batch value passed as ``tl.constexpr`` --
is named, or raises under ``TOKENSPEED_JIT_COMPILE_CHECK=error``.
