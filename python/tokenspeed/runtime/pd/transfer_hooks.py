"""EventLoop-side PD transfer-event integration.

The KV transfer executors (prefill/decode) DECIDE — they own the senders /
receivers and surface progress as PD events. ``PdTransferHooks`` here ACTS on
those events with the event loop's collaborators (output processor, data
plane) and returns the enriched event list for the loop to advance the
scheduler with — feedback into the scheduler stays an explicit
``advance_scheduler`` call in the loop body.
