"""Scheduler (virtual) cache block IDs to this rank's local pages, on the CPU.

The scheduler addresses every cache group by virtual block ID; a group with
``shard_count`` D assigns those IDs cyclically to D owners, and a replicated
group (D == 1) owns every ID itself. The same translation serves both, so the
zeroing path never asks which case it is in.
