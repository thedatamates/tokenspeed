"""The cache-group router: the one place scheduler blocks become kernel pages.

``CacheGroupRouter`` is the runner-facing attention backend for every model
whose attention is paged KV. It holds one ``PagedAttentionBackend`` leaf per
attention (history-family) cache group and is the only object between the
scheduler bridge and the kernels that expands raw group tables:

* it learns each group's block granularity from the pool's published specs
  (``CacheGroupGeometry``) and each leaf's kernel page size, and expands the
  bridge's raw per-group block tables into kernel page tables — the single
  logical -> physical mapping point cache-concepts.md Principle 5 asks for;
* it derives every KV write location (extend spans, the decode / verify
  window, and the draft steps the drafters publish) from those same tables,
  so slot math has exactly one home;
* it dispatches a layer's forward to the leaf of ``layer.group_id`` with
  that group's write locations.

Leaves see ``page_table`` / ``seq_lens`` / ``out_cache_loc``. Indexers consume
resolved ``group_view`` results for cross-group indexing. Their verification
state is registered at startup on the outermost backend and committed through
its side-state hook, independently of these leaves. A single-group model is a
router with one leaf; there is no single-table special case.
