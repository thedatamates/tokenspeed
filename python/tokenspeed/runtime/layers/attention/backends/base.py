"""The runner-facing attention backend contract.

An ``AttentionBackend`` is what ``ForwardStepRunner`` / ``ModelExecutor`` /
``PrefillGraph`` talk to: it receives the scheduler bridge's per-group
``block_tables`` (raw scheduler blocks, batch-ordered) on every metadata
call and answers the model's ``forward``. Three kinds of node implement it:

* ``CacheGroupRouter`` — the paged-KV composite that maps blocks to kernel
  pages once and fans out to ``PagedAttentionBackend`` leaves (``paged.py``);
* composites that wrap a router next to a state consumer (hybrid GDN/KDA,
  Inkling's conv columns, MSA's sparse layers);
* block consumers that read raw tables of their own state groups (Mamba /
  KDA state paging, DeepSeek-V4's bespoke multi-group backend).

``block_tables`` is always a complete mapping — the runner synthesizes
placeholder tables for capture, idle and warmup — so no implementation
carries a "no tables" arm. Padding is the consumer's job: requests in
``[actual_bs, bs)`` are dummies it must route to the null page itself.

    carry no indexer and reuse the previous indexer layer's selection
    (``indexer_types == "shared"``), and an MTP head may reuse the target's
    selection for its draft steps. The indexer layer that computes a

    — as scratch outside the graph-guarded metadata slots — and the node
    clears it when it builds the next forward's metadata; between draft
    steps the drafter carries it across explicitly.

    ``prefill`` covers the extend rows, ``decode`` the decode rows (or the
    verify window); each family stores its own record type. ``qsa_metadata``
