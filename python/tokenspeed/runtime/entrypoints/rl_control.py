"""Control-endpoint helpers for the in-engine RL control app (the HTTP surface slime drives).

The engine advertises where its control app listens and what it can do so a
fronting gateway (SMG, ``crates/rl``) can drive it without guessing. The
label keys are SMG's ``rl.*`` capability-override keys; SMG's discovery turns
every key here into a worker label. The one engine import is the scheduler's
``SUPPORTED_WEIGHT_UPDATE_SOURCES``, so the advertisement cannot drift from what
the dispatcher implements; the module still needs no model to import.
