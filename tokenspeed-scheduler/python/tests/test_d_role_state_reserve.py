"""Regression test for the D-role KV-capacity deadlock (Kimi-K3 shaped config).

Root cause: a D-role remote admission used to give each snapshot-state group (KDA)
exactly one materialized block and ``reserve_tokens=0``, without accounting for
decode growth. ``groupReserveTokens`` now secures that growth at admission.
At its first block boundary every request previously needed one
fresh EMPTY parent per state group (packing 1).  When the prefill side is slow the
pool fills with whole-prompt reservations before any KV lands; once fewer than
(#state groups) empty parents remain, no landed request can take its first
decode step, none finishes, none frees pages, and ``maybeRetractForCapacity`` is
inert because ``max_new_tokens <= kRetractionSafeSteps`` exempts every resident
request -> permanent, silent deadlock (``#running-req 0``, ``#queue-req 0``,
``#pages total-2/total``).

Small-scale reproduction: K3-shaped 4-group config (1 History + 3 State groups,
P = 2 tokens per block, 32 usable pages).  Prompts of exactly one block (2
tokens) with max_new_tokens = 4.  On the unfixed scheduler each admission
reserves ceil((2+4)/2) = 3 History pages + 3 state blocks = 6 pages; five of
them fill 30 of 32 pages, and landing all five afterwards leaves 2 < 3 empty
parents, so no forward op is ever produced again.  With the growth reserve each
admission takes 3 + 6 = 9 pages: three requests are admitted, the rest queue,
and every landed request decodes from its own banked block.
