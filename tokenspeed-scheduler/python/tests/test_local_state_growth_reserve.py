"""Local (Fused-role) counterpart of the D-role state-group growth reserve.

An aligned prompt has no tail to split, so its completing admission used to
materialize one state block with zero spare and its first decode step needed a
fresh EMPTY parent per state group -- the D-role wedge, on the local path.
``groupReserveTokens`` banks one growth block on every admission that
finishes shaping a state group, so the first decode step is consumed in place.

Shape: K3-shaped 4-group config (P = 2 tokens per block, 32 usable pages),
one-block aligned prompts, max_new_tokens = 4.  Unfixed: 3 History pages + 3
state blocks = 6 pages per admission, five of six prompts admit (30/32) and
wedge at their first decode.  Fixed: 9 pages per admission, three admit, three
queue, everything finishes.
