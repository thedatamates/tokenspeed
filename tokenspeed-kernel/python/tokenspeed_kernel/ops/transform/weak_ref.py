"""Non-owning tensor view for CUDA-graph break closures.

``weak_ref_tensor(t)`` returns a tensor aliasing ``t``'s memory WITHOUT owning
its storage (``at::from_blob`` with a no-op deleter). A breakable-CUDA-graph
break closure that holds such a view does not pin ``t``'s mempool block, so the
graph pool can recycle blocks across segments and captures -- graph memory
drops from sum-over-buckets of break inputs back to ~peak-live. Correctness
relies on replay order: the captured segment rewrites the aliased address
before the break reads it, every replay (the same discipline that lets the
decode graph share one pool across batch sizes).

Adapted from vLLM ``csrc/ops.h`` / SGLang ``sgl-kernel/csrc/memory/
weak_ref_tensor.cpp``. Compiled lazily via ``torch.utils.cpp_extension``
(pure C++ against ATen -- no nvcc, no wheel rebuild); falls back to identity
(strong ref: correct, more memory) if compilation is unavailable.
