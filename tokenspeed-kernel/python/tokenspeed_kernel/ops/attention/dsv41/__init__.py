"""DeepSeek V4.1 cache codecs, sparse attention and hierarchical selection.

Importing this family registers its Triton, AMD Gluon, and optional native
solutions.

Standalone packed rows place value bytes before scales (even FP4 element in
low nibble). Formats: global = 512D E2M1/E4M3 groups of16, 288 bytes;
index = 128D E2M1/E8M0 groups of32, 68 bytes; SWA = 512D E4M3/E8M0
 groups of32, 528 bytes -- the entire post-RoPE vector is quantized. The
swa_v4/global_v4 rows are the same 512D content in FlashMLA's V4 layout: a
576-byte data row of 448 E4M3 NoPE bytes then the 64 RoPE dims left as BF16,
and an 8-byte scale row of E8M0 per64 with a pad byte. They exist for targets
whose FlashMLA reads V4 only.

Paged fields use page-planar storage: all64 value rows, then all64 scale rows.
Their uint8 [pages,64,row_bytes] shape describes storage, not decoded row axes.
Portable codecs honor every byte stride; native kernels require contiguous
page bytes and aligned page strides. Physical slots address a particular field;
invalid slots read zero or skip writes. Callers own mapping, causal lengths,
RoPE, normalization, output buffers and cache lifetime.

The ``dspark_*`` helpers serve the checkpoint-local DSpark drafter, whose
context windows are BF16 [pages,64,512] fields of the SWA group: one launch
per stage turns projected rows into window rows (kv_norm, RoPE, the SWA
codec's quantize-dequantize round trip, masked scatter), one launch derives a
verify step's bonus tokens and anchors, and one launch expands anchors into
the block's ids, positions, HC mix and workspace addressing.

    plus gathered Q/weights, independent of configured or visible history.
    FP32 scores and int64 IDs use12 bytes per partial entry; capacities round
    to powers of two and at least the score tile width (at most256 lanes).
    With replicated32 heads and compatible Blackwell pages, optional DeepGEMM
    scores packed FP4 inputs with FP32 accumulation and DeepSelect selects rows
    and block maxima; on Hopper, DeepGEMM scores FP8 ``index_v4`` rows and the
    in-tree CuTe DSL DeepSelect kernel selects. This native accumulation
    differs from the portable reference's intermediate BF16 rounding. Native query tiles cap logits at
    32MiB for paged queries and 128MiB for a zero-row-stride request table.
    That broadcast layout gathers packed history once per call and packs Q
    once before the score tiles; no payload survives the call. For unsharded
    68-byte MXFP4 caches, AMD Gluon Full similarly caps each FP32 logits query
    tile at 32MiB instead of limiting history width; Reindex scores only the
