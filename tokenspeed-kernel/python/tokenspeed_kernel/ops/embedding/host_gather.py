"""Gather uint8 rows from a host-resident table onto the device.

The table stays in pinned / cudaHostRegistered host memory. The kernel reads
it through a device-visible pointer (UVA on NVIDIA, hipHostGetDevicePointer
on AMD). Invalid indices write zeros. Callers own dequantization so FP8/E8M0
rounding stays with the same torch casts as the GPU-resident path.
