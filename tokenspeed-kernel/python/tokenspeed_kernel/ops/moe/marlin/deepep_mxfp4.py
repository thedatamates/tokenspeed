"""Marlin W4A16 MXFP4 MoE over DeepEP all-to-all (SM90).

The replicated-token Marlin path runs every rank over the full token batch and
all-reduces; with attention DP that additionally needs a cross-DP all-gather.
This kernel replaces both collectives with DeepEP's token-level legs: dispatch
routes each token only to the ranks owning its top-k experts, the local Marlin
grouped GEMM computes those experts' contributions, and combine reduces the
per-expert partials back to the token's home rank.

Activations stay bf16 on the wire (Marlin is weight-only quant; there is no
FP8 activation form to exploit), so dispatch carries a single bf16 tensor.

Both DeepEP modes are supported, and their receive layouts differ:

- Normal (extend-shaped): flat rows with local ``topk_ids`` whose non-local
  slots arrive as -1. Marlin consumes these local IDs directly; route weights
  fold into GEMM2 and combine reduces unweighted.
- Low-latency (decode-shaped): a padded per-expert buffer with device counts.
  The adapter compacts valid rows, directly builds Marlin's aligned block
  schedule, and reuses the receive buffer for the result. Only combine
  applies the real route weights.

Intranode traffic runs the NVLink P2P fast path in both modes; the IBGDA
requirement only bites for internode low-latency traffic.
