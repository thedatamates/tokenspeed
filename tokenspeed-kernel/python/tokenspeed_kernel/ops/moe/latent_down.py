"""Multicast down-projection for Kimi-K3's latent MoE.

The replicated projection streams the whole 51.4 MB weight on every rank. Here
each rank owns a contiguous block of the output columns, publishes that block
straight into every peer's symmetric mailbox through the NVLS multicast
address, and a Lamport gather turns the mailbox into the full latent without a
barrier. The weight block is a view, so nothing is duplicated.

Two producers write that block, split at the width the fused kernel supports.
Up to eight rows a fused SIMT GEMM computes and publishes in one launch. Wider
batches hand the multicast address to cuBLAS as its output tensor, which
broadcasts the same way for the price of the store -- but skips the epilogue
that keeps the fused path's output off the Lamport sentinel. Those widths stay
off it for two other reasons: the mailbox is armed with a word both BF16 lanes
spell -0, which a product would have to reach twice over rather than once, and
the publish overwrites rather than accumulates onto rows still holding
sentinels. Which producer serves them is chosen in one place, ``_wide_producer``.

Every rank must construct in lockstep: the mailbox rendezvous is collective.
