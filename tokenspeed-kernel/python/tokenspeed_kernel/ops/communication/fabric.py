"""Readiness probe for CUDA fabric-handle (MNNVL) memory.

Multi-node NVLink buffers need the full IMEX stack (nvidia-imex daemon plus
/dev/nvidia-caps-imex-channels), which only exists on NVLink-domain machines
such as GB200 NVL72. Machine-type, device-attribute and NVLS-multicast checks
are all insufficient: drivers report fabric-handle *support* and multicast
support on hosts where the IMEX stack is absent and the allocation itself fails
with CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED. Every MNNVL consumer therefore has to probe the
allocation, so the probe lives here instead of being duplicated per consumer.
