# TokenSpeed-kernel

TokenSpeed-kernel aims to provide a collection of the best portable and
performant kernels for multi-silicon AI inference. It features:

* A clean layered API for maximal structured flexibility
* Kernel registration and selection logic to decouple complexity and increase reuse
* Plugin mechanism for multi-silicon extensibility
* A minimal list of curated dependencies for fast iteration

TokenSpeed-kernel is pip-installable on its own and can be directly used by
others.

## Nightly installation

CUDA 13 nightly wheels are published daily from `main` for Linux x86_64 and
ARM64, with Python 3.10–3.13. Versions append the UTC build date to the base
version, for example `0.1.3.post20260929`.

```bash
pip install --upgrade tokenspeed-kernel \
  --extra-index-url https://lightseek.org/whl/nightly
```

PyPI supplies dependencies that are absent from the nightly index. To select a
specific nightly, use `tokenspeed-kernel==0.1.3.post20260929`. Post releases sort
above the corresponding base release and do not require `--pre`.

The `Build and Release tokenspeed-kernel` workflow also supports manual nightly
builds from pull request branches. To publish manually, run it from `main` with
both `nightly` and `publish_github` enabled. Same-day reruns preserve already
published wheels.
Historical nightlies are retained; automatic cleanup is deferred.

## Design Goals

TokenSpeed-kernel is designed with the following functionality goals in mind:

* Support various kernels in AI models (attention, MoE, etc.)
* Support multiple silicon vendors and generations
* Marry default portability and performance solutions

In addition, to have a better devflow for fast iteration:

* Provide unified infra to verify and debug kernel numerics standalone
* Provide unified infra to run and benchmark kernels standalone
* Support tracing shapes and profiling workloads at runtime
* Stay forward-looking, with guardrails for agentic devflow

## Overall Design

With the above goals in mind, we have made the following opinionated design
choices (still evolving; subject to change):

### Layered system

```

- **Registration** — backends register with `@register_kernel(family, mode, ...)`,
  declaring supported `format_signatures`, arch capability requirements,
  non-format traits (head dim, GQA factor, ...), and a priority band.
- **Auto-selection** — `select_kernel` filters by capability and traits,
  ranks the survivors with an optional per-family `SelectionOracle` and
  priority, and returns a callable. Selection supports per-call `solution=`
  and `override=` plus config-file overrides for development.

### Directory structure

```
tokenspeed_kernel/
  __init__.py            # Public API re-exports
  platform.py            # PlatformInfo, capability detection
  signature.py           # TensorFormat, ScaleFormat, FormatSignature
  registry.py            # KernelRegistry, register_kernel, Priority bands
  selection.py           # select_kernel, oracles, overrides
  profiling.py           # ShapeCapture, kernel_scope, Proton bootstrap
  _triton.py             # Single import point for the vendored Triton fork

  ops/
    attention/   { mha/, mla/, dsa/, ... }
    gemm/        { triton.py, trtllm.py, ... }
    moe/         { triton.py, deepep.py, triton_kernels.py, ... }
    ...

  numerics/              # Reference impls + tolerance + comparison + CLI
    reference/           # PyTorch ground-truth kernels
  benchmark/             # Unified runner, throughput model, report, CLI
  plugins/               # Out-of-tree backend discovery
  thirdparty/            # Vendored / wrapped third-party kernel sources
```

Each `ops/<family>/` directory groups implementations by operator variant and
then solution. For example, attention uses `attention/<variant>/<solution>.py`
such as `attention/mha/triton.py`. A solution is either an in-tree JIT kernel
(Triton/Gluon/CuteDSL), or a thin wrapper around an external library.
All of them register through the same decorator and are scored by the same
selection logic, so adding a backend is one new file in the right family
folder.

### Solution choices

- **Triton** — in-tree; default portable JIT path for various kernels, including
  precomputed-routing MoE with unquantized or MXFP4 expert weights
- **Gluon / CuteDSL** — in-tree; performant JIT path for key kernels
- **gfx950 block-FP8 MoE** — direct compact-weight Gluon warp GEMVs for
  decode-shaped batches and tuned BF16 Gluon kernels for prefill. BF16 expert
  copies are created at load time while compact FP8 experts remain available
  for decode
- **Vendor libraries** — wrapped (FlashAttention, TRT-LLM, etc.);
  no in-tree C++ build
- **PyTorch reference** — under `numerics/reference/`; never auto-selects
  over a real backend but always available as ground truth

Overall we carefully curate external dependencies and actively re-evaluate
their inclusion, in order to maintain minimal dependencies and enable faster
iteration.

### Numerics, benchmarking, profiling

- `python -m tokenspeed_kernel.numerics` — dtype-aware tolerances, standard
  input generators, and a comparison/bisect flow that pits any registered
  kernel against the reference impl.
- `python -m tokenspeed_kernel.benchmark` — unified timing, throughput
  (FLOPs / bytes) per op family, tabular reports, and Proton integration.
- `KernelBenchmarkHarness` — registration-level device timing through warmed
  graph replay, with raw samples, resolved registration metadata, and explicit
  failure outcomes.
- Runtime shape capture feeds replay and tuning workflows; `kernel_scope`
  scopes are visible in Proton/Chrome traces. The joint BF16 `mm` fast path
  records the same shape metadata and scopes as registry-selected kernels.
- End-to-end serving: POST `/start_profile` with
  `{"activities": ["PROTON"]}`, run the workload, then POST `/stop_profile`.
  Each scheduler process — the process where
  kernels actually launch — runs its own Proton session and finalizes it on
  `/stop_profile`, writing
  `<output_dir>/<profile_id>[-DP<rank>][-CP<rank>]-TP<rank>.proton.<fmt>`
  per rank. `PROTON` composes only with host-side activities (`CPU`, `MEM`,
  `VIZTRACER`). To see Python activity and Proton's kernel lanes on one
  Perfetto timeline, profile with `VIZTRACER` + `PROTON`
  (`TOKENSPEED_KERNEL_PROFILE_DATA=trace`,
  `TOKENSPEED_KERNEL_PROFILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT=chrome_trace`), then merge the
  traces with `tokenspeed merge-traces`.

Registration-level benchmarks combine operation-owned input and correctness
logic with graph-replay device timing. Each operation family and mode
contributes one benchmark generator; suites reference them by family, mode,
and parameters. Pull request CI compares compatible cases between the merge
base and candidate revision. See the
[benchmark documentation](benchmarks/README.md) for the harness and suite
contract, and the [CI documentation](../test/ci/README.md#registration-level-kernel-benchmarks)
for workflow behavior and runner requirements.

### JIT compilation while serving

Compile-time kernel parameters (`tl.constexpr`, `gl.constexpr`) key the
Triton compile cache, so a per-batch value passed as one compiles a new binary
on the forward thread for every new batch shape (100 ms to seconds each).
`tokenspeed_kernel.compile_monitor` hooks Triton's JIT (Gluon shares it) and
records every compilation. The runtime installs it in each scheduler process
and marks the end of startup; after that each compilation is logged with its
duration, what changed in the compile key, and the launching call site, and a
compile-time parameter that keeps taking new values from one call site is
named (`TOKENSPEED_JIT_COMPILE_CHECK=warn`, the default) or raises (`error`,
which CI serving jobs use). Kernel tests guard batch-varying launches with
`assert_no_triton_compile` in `test/utils.py`. JITs outside Triton, such as
DeepGEMM's per-shape kernels, are not observed and need the same discipline
at their call sites.
The end-of-startup mark is also the package's compile switch, set whether or
not the monitor is installed. A kernel whose library compiles once per batch
shape and cannot bucket it, such as FlashInfer's joint BF16 GEMM (some runners
compile per exact row count) or the ll_bf16 router's dot-product kernel, checks
`compile_monitor.is_serving()` where it is dispatched: startup tuning and graph capture use it, and eager calls while
serving take a GEMM that never compiles (cuBLAS through torch on NVIDIA).

### Plugins

`python -m tokenspeed_kernel.plugins` lists discovered out-of-tree backends.
Plugins register via the same `@register_kernel` decorator from their own
package, set their own priority, and participate in selection like in-tree
backends. See `tokenspeed_kernel/plugins/README.md`.

## Public API

```python
from tokenspeed_kernel import (
    gated_residual_mix, gated_residual_combine, grouped_gemma_rmsnorm,
    mm,
    moe_topk,
    moe_route, moe_dispatch, moe_experts, moe_combine, moe_fused,
    ...
)
from tokenspeed_kernel.ops.attention.gdn import gdn_chunk_prefill
from tokenspeed_kernel.ops.attention.mha import (
    mha_decode_with_kvcache,
    mha_prefill,
)
from tokenspeed_kernel.ops.attention.msa import (
    msa_decode_with_kvcache,
    msa_extend_with_kvcache,
)
```

Using the above platform and solution-agnostic public APIs can get the most
value out of TokenSpeed-kernel; but one can also directly call into a
specific solution under `ops/<family>/`, or manually `select_kernel` with
targeted filters.

For targeted selection:

```python
from tokenspeed_kernel.selection import select_kernel, kernel_override
```

For platform checks:

```python
from tokenspeed_kernel.platform  import current_platform
```
