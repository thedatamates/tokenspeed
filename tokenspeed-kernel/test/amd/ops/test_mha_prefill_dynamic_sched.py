"""The work counter decides placement at runtime; the result must not depend
on it.

A nonzero ``skip_softmax_threshold`` switches the persistent scheduler to a
global atomic ticket counter, so which workgroup runs which (batch, head,
query block) varies between runs of the same launch. Each item writes a
disjoint output slice.

Checks (bf16, causal):
  [1] COVERAGE     matches dense SDPA at a threshold too small to skip, so a
                   dropped or duplicated ticket cannot pass as sparsity
  [2] DETERMINISM  repeated launches are bit-identical
  [3] SHAPES       GQA ratios 1, 2, 4 and 8, the group sizes the ticket
                   decode interleaves over
  [4] RAGGED       mixed lengths, one below BLOCK_M, covering the padded
                   tail of the ticket space
  [5] SLIDING      the sliding kernel keeps the static order

No speedup is asserted: the benefit depends on sparsity being unevenly
distributed across heads, which random Q/K/V does not reproduce.
