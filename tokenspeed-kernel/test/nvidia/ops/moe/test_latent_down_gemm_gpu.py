"""The multicast GEMM's column fold, exercised on one GPU through a local pointer.

The launcher folds this rank's column base into the pointer it is handed, so
every peer receives this rank's shard at the right columns and the Lamport
sentinels around it survive for the others. Nothing else in the suite runs that
arithmetic: the runtime tests mock the launcher, and the only end-to-end
exerciser is a manual eight-rank program.
