"""Staged NVLS multimem all-reduce: must match NCCL all-reduce across the
latent (3584) and hidden (7168) widths on both sides of every runtime
threshold, survive buffer growth (doubling re-allocation + re-rendezvous,
replaced buffers retired not freed, no shrink on smaller re-stage), keep the
per-width buffer caches independent, refuse unsupported inputs by returning
None, and honor the documented view-invalidation contract.

Normal one-GPU pytest runs skip this file. Exercise it with:
