# Run the test suite as several concurrent rocJITsu workers on one runner.
#
# A single emulator saturates about two cores, so running the suite serially
# leaves most of a 32-core runner idle. Six pytest-xdist workers under one
# shared daemon are no faster than serial, because the daemon serialises their
# kernels; on one directory that measured 207s against 80s. Pointing xdist's
# --tx gateway at a wrapper that starts its own daemon gives each worker a
# private emulator, which recovers the speed (83s on the same directory) while
# leaving the scheduling to xdist, so no per-file cost table has to be kept in
# step with the tests as they are added and removed.
