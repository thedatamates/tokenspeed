"""The KDA cache sanitizes its latent writes; the plain MLA cache does not.

Context (the Kimi-K3 CUDA-graph "!!!" bug): under the prefill breakable graph,
the dummy-batch capture (out_cache_loc == the reserved ``dummy_kv_slot``)
writes NaN K/V. The paged MLA decode kernel then reads that shared dummy slot
through the zero-padded block-table entries and computes ``q.k`` *before* the
causal mask, so ``NaN + -inf = NaN`` survives the mask and poisons a live row's
softmax -> all-NaN logits -> ``argmax`` picks token 0 ("!"). Eager prefill
leaves the dummy slot finite (``q.0`` masks cleanly), so the bug only appears
with the prefill graph on.

Sanitization is a fact of *this cache*, not of a wrapper around it: the pool
class declares ``latent_write_sanitizes`` and every write path reads it, so
that declaration IS the contract -- and it holds for every view of the arena,
target or draft. It lives on the class rather than in ``set_mla_kv_buffer``'s
signature because a pool that only changes the default must keep the base
method identity that the fused-write gate checks.
