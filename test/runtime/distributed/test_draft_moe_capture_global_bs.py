"""Draft collective sizing must agree between capture and replay.

A draft first step narrows the target's verify window to one live row per
request. Models report that shape through ``report_collective_sizing`` using
``ctx.bs`` and ``ctx.global_bs``. Without the global batch counts at capture,
collectives fall back to ``global_num_tokens``, which still describes the
wider target verify window, and record different sizes from live replay.

CPU-only tests exercise this context contract without GPU collectives.
