"""The CUPTI graph-capture warm-up is opt-in, on every vendor.

``_init_for_cuda_graphs()`` opens an empty profiler session so that CUPTI is
loaded before any CUDA graph is captured. On ROCm there is no CUPTI: torch
profiles through roctracer, and that empty session leaves activity collection
permanently dead for the life of the process. Every later ``/start_profile``
then returns a trace containing ``cpu_op`` entries and zero ``"cat": "kernel"``
entries, on every rank, in eager and graph mode alike -- silently, since the
request still reports success.

Measured on 8x gfx950 serving Kimi-K3: 0 GPU events on all 8 ranks with the
warm-up, 62k kernel events in the same decode trace without it. CUPTI behaves
the same way -- measured on CUDA 13.0 / torch 2.13, 2xGB300 TP8: 0 kernel
events with the warm-up, 933k across 340 graph replays without it, and no
launch failure from attaching after capture. So the warm-up is off unless
``TOKENSPEED_CUPTI_GRAPH_WARMUP`` asks for it.

CPU-only: no CUDA context, no profiler session, just the gate decision.
