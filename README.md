TokenSpeed is a speed-of-light LLM inference engine designed for **agentic workloads**, with TensorRT-LLM-level performance and vLLM-level usability. Our goal is to be the most performant inference engine for production agentic workloads.

Core components:

- **Modeling layer**: local-SPMD design with a static compiler that generates
  collective communication from module-boundary placement annotations, so users
  do not hand-write parallelism logic.
- **Scheduler**: C++ control plane and Python execution plane. Request
  lifecycle, KV cache ownership, and overlap timing are encoded as a
  finite-state machine, with safe KV resource reuse enforced by the type system at compile time.
- **Kernels**: pluggable, layered kernel system with a portable public API and
  a centralized registry including one of the fastest **MLA**
  (Multi-head Latent Attention) implementations on Blackwell for agentic workload.
- **Entrypoint**: SMG-integrated AsyncLLM for low-overhead CPU-side request
  handling.
